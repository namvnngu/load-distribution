# Load Distribution By Genetic Algorithm

<i>
<b>Problem Description</b>: The purpose of this task is to distribute computing jobs amongst several nodes on a server.
Each job requires a processing time, measured in number of operations, and each node has
an efficiency (processing power), measured in number of operations per second.

Minimise the total runtime to complete all jobs.
</i>

**Solution**: 
- Implemented Genetic Algorithm to find the minimum total runtime
- Implemented [Gurobi Package](https://www.gurobi.com/)

**Package Requirement**:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- gurobi
